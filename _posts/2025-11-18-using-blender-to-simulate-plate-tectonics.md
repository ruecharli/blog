title: "Using Blender to simulate plate tectonics"

In recent years, many aspiring worldbuilders have attempted to model realistic plate tectonics for their fictional worlds. The majority of in-depth tutorials use GPlates - a wonderfully scientific program, though hardly designed for this purpose. The interface is quite foreign to the average worldbuilder, eating away at time better spent learning more about plate tectonics.

My proposition: Blender. With extensive help from the community, I've taken care of the technical side so that you can focus on pure animation.

Thank you very much to tom_paul, ruuubick, and mereluk on Discord for the help!

Note: Once set up, Blender may be used in place of GPlates in most tutorials. I recommend ~20 frames with a step of 50Ma. If you're new to plate tectonics, I thoroughly recommend using a tutorial by Artifexian or Worldbuilding Pasta.
